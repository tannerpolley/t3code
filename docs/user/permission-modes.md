# Permission modes

Permission modes control when an agent needs your approval to act. Choose a mode in the message
composer; it applies to that thread.

Set the default for new threads in **Settings → General → New threads → Permissions**.
Projects can override the environment default. New threads use this setting rather than the
mode of the thread you were viewing. The initial default is **Full access**; existing threads
and modes you choose in a draft keep their permissions.

| Mode                  | Behavior                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supervised**        | Requests approval for commands and file changes.                                      |
| **Auto-accept edits** | Approves file edits automatically; other actions can still require approval.          |
| **Auto**              | Uses the provider's automatic review to approve routine actions and ask about others. |
| **Full access**       | Allows commands and edits without approval prompts.                                   |

Approve or reject requests in the conversation to let the agent continue. Permission modes do
not prevent the agent from asking questions about the task.

## Ask mode

**Ask mode** lets agents wait for your answers and approvals. Toggle it in the sidebar footer or
in **Settings → General → Ask mode** (also available in **Customizations**). Orange means it is on;
gray means it is off.

Turn Ask mode off when you step away. While it is off, the server answers for you the moment an
agent waits: it approves each request once, and answers each question with its first option (the
agent's recommendation) plus a note asking the agent to list the decisions it made. Turning it off
also answers everything already waiting in every thread, including delegated ones. Automatic
answers retain the conversation labels **Answered by Don't ask mode** and **Approved by Don't ask
mode**. Turn Ask mode on to have agents wait for you again.

The sidebar switch belongs to your primary environment's server, so automatic answers keep working
with no client open and the setting persists after a restart. Requests left waiting across a
server restart are handled the way a restart normally handles them. Agents cannot change the setting.

## Provider differences

Providers enforce permissions differently. Some read-only actions can proceed in **Supervised**.
**Auto** uses automatic review on Codex, Claude, Cursor, and Grok; providers without an equivalent,
including OpenCode and Antigravity, fall back to asking. On Grok, commands its review blocks come
to you for approval.

Muse Code offers only **Supervised** and **Full access**. A Muse thread already set to another mode
runs in **Supervised**.

Grok offers no **Auto-accept edits**. A Grok thread already set to it runs in **Supervised**. Grok
file-change approvals offer **Allow all edits this session**. Its command approvals have no
session-wide choice, because Grok would remember that command for the whole project.

ACP Registry agents run their own tools in their own mode; T3 Code answers their approval requests
by the permission mode. See [ACP Registry permissions](./providers-acp.md#permissions-and-terminals).

Claude can still ask in **Full access** when its settings disable bypass permissions or require
approval for an action.
While a Claude approval is pending, type a text reply to decline that request and give feedback
directly to the agent that asked, including a subagent. Other pending requests stay unanswered.

Antigravity can still send native approval requests in **Full access**. It only offers remembered
approvals for actions that support them.

See the [provider guides](./install.md#providers) for setup and provider-specific limits.
